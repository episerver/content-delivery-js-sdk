# How to contribute

## Did you find a bug?

* Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability, instead contact support@optimizely.com.

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/episerver/content-delivery-js-sdk/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/episerver/content-delivery-js-sdk/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Don't surprise us with a large pull requests. Instead, file an issue and start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time.

## Do you have questions about the source code?

* Ask any question about how to use this code on the [Optimizely World forum](https://world.optimizely.com/forum/).
